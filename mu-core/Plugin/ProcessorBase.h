// Abstract base for all mu-family plugin processors.
//
// Owns the three pieces every mu-family plugin shares:
//   1. apvts  — the APVTS instance. Derived plugins supply the layout
//               at construction (createParameterLayout()).
//   2. fxChain + mixerEngine — shared DSP plumbing.
// Provides processCoreBlock() as the common per-block mixing entry point.
// Derived classes supply the trigger engine (Euclidean, MIDI, etc.) and
// call processCoreBlock() from their own processBlock().
//
// Keeping apvts on the base lets mu-core UI components (MixerChannel, FXRow,
// MixerOverlay) take a `ProcessorBase*` instead of forward-declaring each
// plugin's concrete `PluginProcessor` type — eliminates the layering
// violation that previously had mu-core including mu-clid headers.
